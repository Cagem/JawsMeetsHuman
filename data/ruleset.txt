The rules go like this:
Two players are required. Player 1's goal is to move the human safely along the path. If the human reaches the end of the path, he has won. Player 2 tries to stop him, he plays the shark. The human can be controlled with the W, A, S and D keys and should not leave the path, he is a better runner than swimmer. The shark is moved by the arrow keys, its line of sight is controlled by the mouse. If the shark approaches the path, it can jump over the path by pressing return. If its mouth is directed towards the human, it can swallow him.

The background music can be muted with M and the volume is controled by keys 4 (vol. down) and 5 (vol. up).
